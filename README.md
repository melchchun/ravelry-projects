ravelry-projects
================

Display your pending Ravelry projects. It shows any project pictures (with a link to upload in-progress photos), a link to your Ravelry project page, and any todo items that you've entered into your project notes.

In order to get a todo list to show up on the page, you must preface your list in the notes section with "todo", "to do," or "to-do." If you wish to type more notes below your todo list, you can end your todo list with another "todo", "to do," or "to-do."

You will need to copy api.yml.example to api.yml and put in your own username and access_token. You can find this info on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/help/api">Ravelry's project API page</a>
